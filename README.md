# Memory Execution Visualizer

**Memory Execution Visualizer** (MemExeViz) is a React-based tool designed to help developers and students understand how memory is allocated and manipulated in programming. It provides a step-by-step visualization of stack and heap execution, along with **Bengali explanations**, making complex memory concepts more accessible.

## Features

* **Step-by-step memory visualization** for both **stack** and **heap**.
* Visual representation of function calls, variable allocations, and memory deallocation.
* **Bengali explanations** to make learning memory management easier for native speakers.
* Interactive and responsive UI to guide users through memory execution.
* Detailed view of stack frames, memory addresses, and variable data.

## Demo

Visit the live tool at [Try it out](https://anisurrahmanju.github.io/MemExeViz/)

## Installation

To run the tool locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anisurrahmanju/MemExeViz.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd MemExeViz
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will run the tool locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

* After launching the tool, you will see a UI with two main sections: **Stack** and **Heap**.
* **Stack**: Visualizes memory allocations related to function calls, local variables, and stack frames.
* **Heap**: Visualizes dynamic memory allocations, such as objects or arrays created during runtime.
* Step through the memory execution by pressing the **Next Step** button.
* For each step, you'll receive a **Bengali explanation** that describes what's happening in the memory.
